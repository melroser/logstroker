# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Logstroker is a vim plugin that analyzes keystroke logs generated by vim's `-w` flag to provide users with ergonomic and efficiency suggestions. The plugin will parse vim keylog files, identify patterns in user behavior, and recommend more efficient key combinations, movement patterns, and editing techniques to improve the user's vim workflow and reduce repetitive strain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a vim user, I want to analyze my keystroke patterns from vim keylog files, so that I can identify inefficient editing habits and improve my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a vim keylog file THEN the system SHALL parse and analyze the keystroke data
2. WHEN parsing keylog data THEN the system SHALL identify individual commands, movements, and editing operations
3. WHEN analyzing keystrokes THEN the system SHALL detect repetitive patterns and sequences
4. IF the keylog file is malformed or unreadable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a vim user, I want to receive ergonomic suggestions based on my keystroke analysis, so that I can reduce repetitive strain and improve my typing efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis detects excessive use of arrow keys THEN the system SHALL suggest hjkl movement alternatives
2. WHEN the analysis finds repetitive character-by-character movements THEN the system SHALL recommend word-based or search-based navigation
3. WHEN the analysis identifies frequent ESC key usage THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative mode switching techniques
4. WHEN the analysis detects inefficient text selection patterns THEN the system SHALL recommend visual mode or text object usage
5. WHEN the analysis finds excessive mouse usage THEN the system SHALL suggest keyboard-only alternatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a vim user, I want to see efficiency suggestions for my editing patterns, so that I can learn more advanced vim techniques and reduce keystrokes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis detects repetitive editing operations THEN the system SHALL suggest macro usage or dot command repetition
2. WHEN the analysis finds inefficient search and replace patterns THEN the system SHALL recommend more efficient substitution commands
3. WHEN the analysis identifies manual indentation THEN the system SHALL suggest automatic indentation commands
4. WHEN the analysis detects inefficient file navigation THEN the system SHALL recommend buffer management or file jumping techniques
5. WHEN the analysis finds repetitive text manipulation THEN the system SHALL suggest text objects and operators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a vim user, I want to view my keystroke analysis results in an organized format, so that I can easily understand and act on the suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show suggestions categorized by type (ergonomic, efficiency, navigation)
2. WHEN presenting suggestions THEN the system SHALL include the current inefficient pattern and the recommended alternative
3. WHEN showing analysis results THEN the system SHALL display keystroke frequency statistics
4. WHEN presenting recommendations THEN the system SHALL include brief explanations of why the suggestion is better
5. IF no significant issues are found THEN the system SHALL display a positive confirmation message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a vim user, I want to configure the plugin's analysis sensitivity and suggestion types, so that I can customize the feedback to my skill level and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the plugin THEN the system SHALL allow users to set minimum thresholds for pattern detection
2. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL allow users to enable/disable specific suggestion categories
3. WHEN customizing analysis THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify which keylog files to analyze
4. WHEN saving configuration THEN the system SHALL persist settings between vim sessions
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use default settings and notify the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a vim user, I want the plugin to integrate seamlessly with my vim workflow, so that I can easily access keystroke analysis without disrupting my editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the plugin THEN the system SHALL provide vim commands for analysis functions
2. WHEN running analysis THEN the system SHALL not interfere with normal vim operations
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use vim's native display mechanisms (buffers, windows, or messages)
4. WHEN the plugin encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing vim
5. WHEN loading the plugin THEN the system SHALL have minimal impact on vim startup time
